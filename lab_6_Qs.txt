1. What is a Python library and how do you include one in your script?
	A Python library is a collection of commands that allow you to do things you can't normally do and control external hardware.

2. What does it mean for elements of a circuits to be in series vs. in parallel?
	If the elements are in series, the current flows through them one after the other, while in parallel they are all hooked up to the power seperatly.

3. Can you create a circuit of 3 light bulbs in series? Why or why not?
	yes because there is nothing stopping the current. the lights might explode so you would want a resistor, but it would theoretically work.

4. The stoplight pattern is Green ON for 5 seconds, Yellow ON for 1 seconds, and Red ON for 4 seconds. Define the function f ( t ) as a piecewise function that outputs 1 if the green light is on, 2 if the yellow light is on, and 3 if the red light is on over 10 seconds. The bounds of the function are 0 <= t <= 10

    |0 <= t <= 5, f(t) = 1
f(t){5 < t <= 6, f(t) = 2
    |6 < t <= 10, f(t) = 3

5. Sketch a graph of f ( t ) over 10 seconds using a step-like shape.
